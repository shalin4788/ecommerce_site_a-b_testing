Read a dataframe, cleanse data and unwanted data.
Perform A/B testing by running simulations across sample data using bootstrapping technique and defining hypothesis tests to reject/ accept null hypothesis based on p value determination and comparison with null values. Note: Hypothesis is defined based on the conversion rate comparison between old and new e-commerce sites
Apply regression model to the data depending on the dependent variable outcome determination and determining what independent variable had max impact on the response i.e. conversion rate (probability of leading to purchase) of people visiting new vs old e comm website to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
